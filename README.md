# RISC Raiders
A simple bullet hell written in MIPS Assembly with a modified version of MARS for the final project of our Computer Architecture class at UFPel.
This project was developed by Allan Duarte Ehlert and Eduardo Machado Behling.

## How to play
1. With JDK 11, run the _start.ps1_ Powershell script to set your Java PATH correctly and open EMARS.jar. Alternatively, if you already have your PATH configured properly, just run it.
2. Go to Tools->Game Station GPU, connect to MIPS, assemble and run the _main.asm_ file.
3. Click on the text below the textbox to enable keyboard input.
4. Enjoy the game!
